# Sequelize-ToDo

In week 1 of Back-End Fundamentals, you built a todo list (see project 'Build a todo list'), storing your data in memory.

Revisit this project, either writing it from scratch or editing your previous code, and use Sequelize to store your todos. You should add the ability to edit and delete individual todos.

Hard mode  

Add a button to delete all completed todos.
Sort your todos by their creation date, newest on top.
